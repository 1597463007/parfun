Parafun is a lightweight library providing helpers to **make it easy to write and run a Python function in parallel
and distributed systems**.

The main feature of the library is its `@parafun` decorator that transparently executes standard Python functions
following the [map-reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) pattern:

```Python
from parafun import parafun
from parafun.combine.collection import list_concat
from parafun.partition.api import per_argument
from parafun.partition.collection import list_by_chunk

@parafun(
    split=per_argument(
        values=list_by_chunk
    ),
    combine_with=list_concat,
)
def list_pow(values: List[float], factor: float) -> List[float]:
    return [v**factor for v in values]
```

## Features

* **Provides significant speedups** to existing Python functions
* **Does not require any deep knowledge of parallel or distributed computing systems**
* **Automatically estimates the optimal sub-task splitting** (the *partition size*)
* **Automatically handles data transmission, caching and synchronization**.
* **Supports various distributed computing backends**, including Python's multiprocessing,
  [Scaler](https://github.com/citi/scaler) or Dask.


## Quick Start
The built-in Sphinx documentation contains detailed usage instructions, implementation details, and an exhaustive
API reference.

Use the `doc` Make target to build the HTML documentation from the source code:

```bash
make doc
```

The documentation's main page can then ben found at `docs/build/html/index.html`.

Take a look at our documentation's [quickstart tutorial](./docs/build/html/tutorials/quickstart.html) to get more
examples and a deeper overview of the library.
